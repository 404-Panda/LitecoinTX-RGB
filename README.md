ðŸ§¬ TXHex Visualizer

TXHex Visualizer is a cryptographic image encoder that converts raw blockchain transaction hex into a deterministic, 
visually structured PNG. Each 3-byte chunk becomes a pixel square in an RGB grid, allowing the entire transaction structure to be seen, not just hashed.

ðŸš€ Purpose

This tool enables:

Forensic visualization of raw blockchain transactions

Static art generation from genesis or rare TX data

TXID integrity inclusion (Bitcoin-style double SHA-256)

Scripting-ready image export (TX as image = compact, portable, expressive)
